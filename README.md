## Overview of Financial Metrics

### Current Assets vs. Long-Term Assets
**Definitions**:  
- **Current Assets**: Expected to convert into cash within a year (e.g., cash, accounts receivable, inventory).  
- **Long-Term Assets**: Provide value over multiple years (e.g., property, equipment, intangible assets).

**Factors Influencing Asset Composition**:  
1. **Industry Type**:  
   - Retail businesses often have more current assets.  
   - Companies focusing on intellectual property and patents may have more intangible long-term assets.  
2. **Growth Stage**:  
   - Early-stage companies may focus on accumulating current assets.  
3. **Liquidity Focus**:  
   - Companies prioritizing cash flow optimization tend to maintain higher current assets.

### Debt-to-Equity Ratio and Creditworthiness
**Definition**:  
The **Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio** measures the proportion of debt relative to shareholders' equity in a company’s capital structure.

**Impact on Creditworthiness and Access to Capital**:  
- **Higher D/E Ratio**: Indicates higher risk, leading to increased interest rates or reduced loan accessibility.  
- **Lower D/E Ratio**: Suggests a conservative financing approach, improving access to cheaper capital.  
- **Balanced D/E Ratio**: Demonstrates responsible debt management but under-leveraging may indicate missed growth opportunities.

### Trends in Debt-to-Equity Ratio
**Example Analysis**:  
- **D/E Ratio Over 4 Years**:  
  - 2019: 1.91  
  - 2020: 1.97  
  - 2021: 2.28  

**Findings**:  
- The company increasingly relies on **debt financing** due to its lower cost (2.30%) compared to equity (6.40%).  
- This trend highlights the attractiveness of debt as a funding source but raises concerns about potential risks to financial stability if debt levels continue to rise.

### Revenue Growth Analysis
**Key Insights**:  
- Revenue grew at **9.2% (2020)** and **17.49% (2021)** year-over-year.  
- **Drivers of Growth**:  
  - Merchandise sales dominate the revenue mix and drive growth.  
  - Membership fees contribute but play a secondary role.

### Gross Margin Analysis
**Definition**:  
**Gross Margin** = (Total Revenue - Total Expenses) / Total Revenue  

**Example Analysis**:  
- Gross margin has been consistently maintained at **13%** over the last three years.  
- **Implications**:  
  - Stability in gross margin indicates effective cost management.  
  - Improving margins through cost reduction, operational efficiency, or pricing optimization can enhance profitability and competitiveness.

### Free Cash Flow (FCF) Analysis
**Definition**:  
**Free Cash Flow (FCF)** = Operating Cash Flow − Capital Expenditures  

**Utility for Investors**:  
1. Evaluates a company’s financial flexibility, including its ability to:  
   - Pay dividends.  
   - Repurchase shares.  
   - Invest in growth.  
2. Enables comparisons of companies in the same industry:  
   - Companies with **higher FCF** are better positioned for reinvestment or shareholder returns.  
   - **FCF Yield** (FCF / Market Capitalization) indicates value for investors.  

**Key Considerations**:  
- Consistency in generating FCF over time.  
- Strategic reinvestment of FCF for growth and value creation.
